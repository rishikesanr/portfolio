## Work Experience
**Data Scientist @ Practicum Project at a Leading B2B Lender, USA (_Sept 2023 - Present_)**
-	Conducted data preparation, exploratory analysis, and refined supervised models to predict and score future customers, aiming to reduce client reliance on third-party loan channels by 10%.
-	Created a loan application filter using Python, employing an unsupervised model (K-prototypes) with firmo-graphic and performance features.
- Developed and used matching algorithms to enrich additional features from extensive market data with over 40 million rows, enhancing model effectiveness.

**Data Science Engineer @ Vunet Systems, India (_Oct 2020 - June 2023_)**
- Developed ML pipelines to analyze time series data, devised an original seasonal anomaly detection method, and achieved a 25% higher F1 score compared to benchmarked methods using real datasets from Yahoo.
-	Managed data orchestration for 2,000+ real-time time series analysis at top Indian banks using Dockers, Airflow, and Grafana. 
- Played a big part in development of vuRCABot, cutting down time to fix root causes by 75%. Also, helped design its core data models, which later boosted sales when used in company’s flagship product vuSmartMaps.

**Research Intern @ Deakin University, Australia (_Jan 2019 - July 2019_)**
- Employed data analytics methodologies to develop a mathematical model using an Evolutionary Algorithm, focusing on optimizing water coolant channels on a tool based on existing design data.
- Conducted finite element analysis to analyze temperature variations on an AA7075 Aluminium alloy showcasing the application of data-driven insights in engineering simulations.

## Projects
### [Cardboard Field Experiment](https://github.com/rishikesanr/Field-Experiment-Cardboard-Sign) 

This study explores that with COVID-19, our attitudes toward physical contact could have shifted, affecting our high-five choices. Our experiment shows how small visual cues can shape social behavior, with air high fives remaining popular amid ongoing concerns about health and safety. Also it explores if the gender of someone holding a cardboard sign influences people's preference for physical or air high fives. It's thrilling to uncover these insights into how our behavior evolves in response to changing circumstances.

### [English Premier League Prediction Analytics](https://github.com/rishikesanr/EPL-Prediction-Analytics)

This project means a lot to me. When I was watching a Liverpool game in New York, I started thinking about how well fans could guess the outcome. I wanted to look into this further by checking how fans felt before big football matches and using that to guess who would win. Instead of using old player or match stats, I believe I could use the fans sentiments which I consider to be super fun instrumental variable. This project is still ongoing.

### [Craigslist Content Analysis](https://github.com/rishikesanr/craigslist-content-analysis)

This ongoing project focuses on analyzing the descriptions of free materials listings scraped from Craigslist to uncover valuable insights into the types of items commonly offered for free, trends in popular free materials, and patterns in how these items are described and categorized, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area.
